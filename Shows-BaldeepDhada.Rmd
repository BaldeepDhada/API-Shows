Created the get_seasons(), format_season_name() functions, and updated the main function to handle a show input that doesn't exist in the API. Instead of printing the results as they are, I decided to print the results as a data frame and requested my team members to also make any future results as a data frame.

Made an update to format_season_name to handle empty strings and replace it with ?. Updated the main function to make the output more clean
